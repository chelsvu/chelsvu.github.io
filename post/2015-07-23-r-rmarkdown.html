description = “I can’t believe we are already at the end of the semester! Even with the pandemic going on, I still had a grear year, finding new hobbies, hanging out with close friends and exploring new parts of Austin. I enjoyed taking SDS 348 and learning some coding! I linked my Project 1 below as well as some random R code. Now, I’m looking foward to having a fun, relaxing summer and starting school again in the fall.”
